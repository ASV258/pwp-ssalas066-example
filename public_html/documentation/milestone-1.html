                            <p>Worried about their identity as an artist, but is adept at several illustration styles. Morgan finds herself exhausted after working from 9am-5pm and drawing in the evening. They've used social media to showcase some of their work, but have not created a professional online gallery of their work for potential employers. </p>

                                <p>Morgan needs to hire a web developer to build her site. Using social media and the internet is not an issue for Morgan, but they do no have experience with creating a website. Morgan would be open to building the site themselves, but their day job on top of illustration development does not leaver them with enough time to dedicate to this. Morgan is able to afford a freelance web developer, but needs a quick turnaround time. Morgan has a 5-week deadline for an adequate website to present to the indie game developer. </p>

It is important to Morgan that the web developer align with their aspirations for the site. They want to develop a working relationship with a good communicator, someone that is able to understand their needs and provide adequate work that meets their standards in the future.</p>
