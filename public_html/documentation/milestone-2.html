<!-- Content Strategy -->

<section>
    <div>
        <h2>My site will be one page, and will consist of the following sections</h2>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <div>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>The top left of this section will contain a logo that will be designed further down the line. This section will contain a photo of me on the right side of the page. Animations may be added to spruce up this area. Above the photo, will include a nav bar. The nav bar will include link to send user down to my recent work section, contact me section, and the option to switch between English and Spanish on page. Left side of page beneath logo will have an about me section, with a welcome message and information on my experience. Experience will include javaScript, CSS, HTML, and other skills acquired through the bootcamp. This area will also include brief mission statement on what my goal is for full stack work.</p>
        <p>Mobile version will stack the information and images. The nav bar will be a drop-down menu with the desktop options.</p>

    <div>
        <h2>Recent Work</h2>
        <p>This section will feature images of recent work, links to those pages. Each image will include text underneath with brief details of these sites. Considering pop out animation for hover on images.</p>
        <p>Mobile version will stack these images/text. Will remove pop out animation, I imagine touch input will not translate to it.</p>
    </div>

<section>
    <div>
        <h2>Contact Me</h2>
        <p>This section will feature a contact form for user to include name, email, and message for project proposal. The bottom right of page will include a link button to a professional Telegram for user, for informal contact with questions/ quickly chat instead of submitting a project proposal through contact form. The footer on this section will include links to my professional social media, gitHub, LinkedIn profile, and email. This might remove need for contact form, still working this out. I may also include logo in this footer section</p>
